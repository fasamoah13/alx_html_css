Headphones Project – ALX HTML & CSS

This project is part of the ALX Front-End curriculum, focused on practicing semantic HTML, responsive design, layout structure, and basic interaction styling.
Your task is to recreate a responsive landing page for a “Headphones” brand using the Figma design provided.

📌 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a fully responsive web page based on a Figma file. The page must display correctly on both desktop and mobile screens and include hover/active behavior for links and buttons, as well as a layout that remains centered with a consistent maximum width.

You are expected to:

Reproduce the design as closely as possible

Maintain proper structure using semantic HTML

Organize styles cleanly using CSS

Ensure responsive behavior at the correct breakpoint

🎨 Figma Design

Create a Figma account (if you don’t already have one).

Open the project link provided by ALX.

Click “Duplicate to your Drafts” to access all design components, spacing, colors, and typography.

If the project doesn’t load, use the backup Figma file provided in the task.

Fonts Used

If the fonts don’t appear correctly on your machine, download and install them:

Source Sans Pro

Spin Cycle OT

🧩 Key Requirements
🔹 Layout & Responsiveness

The design must switch to the mobile version at 480px or below.

The content area must not exceed 1000px, and should always be centered on the page.

Spacing values from the Figma file may sometimes appear as floats — you may round them.

🔹 Interactions

Links hover/active color: #FF6565

Button hover/active: opacity: 0.9

🔹 Assets

All images, icons, and illustrations should be used exactly as shown in the Figma file.
Export them from Figma if not already included in the project assets.
